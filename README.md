## Functional Analysis of Variance (F-ANOVA)
Class and supporting functions to utilize an object oriented approach to F-ANOVA

## Description
Functional analyis of variance investigates whether categorical variables affect the mean response. OneWay ANOVA investigates how a single categorical variable with different levels affects the mean response. TwoWay ANOVA investigates how a two categorical variables, denoted Primary and Secondary Factors, each with different levels affects the mean response.
